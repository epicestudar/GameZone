# GameZone Documentation ⏱️

This is a website that I made at the end of June 2023 and beginning of July 2023. The theme is about electronic game events and was made with html, css and javascript.

## Development Process 🚀

- **HTML**: Before starting the project I still didn't have many notions about HTML, however, it was in this project that I actually evolved a lot in HTML and gained an understanding of several of its mechanics. I mostly used HTML to create cards and forms for the events website, in addition to the navbar, buttons and the site's footer.

- **CSS**: The site was created entirely by flexbox, not using bootstrap or any other framework. I organized everything using flexbox because I didn't really like the mechanics of bootstrap, and I hadn't known any other framework until then other than Bootstrap. It was hard work as it contained cards, carousel cards, carousel sliders and accordions, but the end result was worth all the effort!

- **JavaScript**: The site contained little use of javascript because at that time I had still learned almost nothing about the language and there wasn't much time to learn as I needed to deliver the site within the selected deadline. However, with the little I learned, I used javascript to check basic forms and register events that the user created. I also wanted to make sure the user could log in after registering their account, but unfortunately there wasn't enough time.

## Challenges Encountered 🤔

- **Time**: One of my biggest difficulties encountered was delivering a beautiful, responsive and functional website within the estimated deadline. But luckily I managed it, even though I didn't have time to add some other little things I wanted.

- **Responsiveness**: As I didn't use bootstrap or any other framework, I needed to make everything responsive. I encountered some difficulties along the way and left almost everything responsive, except for one part! It was a carousel of cards on the main page that I couldn't make responsive.

## Credits ⏯️

Obviously I didn't do it all alone! To learn so much, I took videos from YouTube, Reddit forums and websites teaching how to do various things! As it's been 3 months since I created this site, unfortunately I couldn't find the links to the videos, websites and forums that helped me, but in any case, thank you very much for your help!
